 1. Plan and Define the Core Components
Before diving into implementation, ensure you have a clear understanding of the following:
- Objects: Define the core objects (e.g., `User`, `Portfolio`, `Stock`) and their attributes and methods.
- Features: List the features your application will support (e.g., user management, portfolio management, marketplace).
- CLI Structure: Plan the menus and commands your CLI will expose to the user.

---

 2. Implement Core Objects (Domain Layer)
Start by implementing the core objects that represent your application's data and logic. These objects should be independent of the CLI.

 Example:
- `User` Class:
  - Attributes: `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc.
  - Methods: `update_profile`, `get_full_name`, etc.
- `Portfolio` Class:
  - Attributes: `name`, `assets`, `value`.
  - Methods: `add_asset`, `remove_asset`, `calculate_value`.

 Steps:
1. Create a `domain` folder to house your core objects.
2. Define each class in its own file (e.g., `domain/User.py`, `domain/Portfolio.py`).
3. Write unit tests for each class to ensure they work as expected.

User
Methods: Add, Delete, Modify?

Portfolio
Methods: View Balance, View %

Stock:
Methods: Buy, Sell
—

Database holds the actual data so functions should be built off of it

 3. Implement Features (Service Layer)
Once the objects are defined, implement the features that use these objects. These features should encapsulate the business logic and interact with the objects.

 Example:
- User Management:
  - Create a `UserService` class to handle user-related operations (e.g., create, delete, update users).
- Portfolio Management:
  - Create a `PortfolioService` class to handle portfolio-related operations (e.g., add/remove assets, calculate portfolio value).

 Steps:
1. Create a `services` folder to house the feature logic.
2. Define service classes that interact with the domain objects.
3. Write unit tests for each service to ensure the features work as expected.

---

 4. Design the CLI (Interface Layer)
Now that the core objects and features are implemented, design the CLI to interact with the user. The CLI should call the appropriate services to perform operations.

 Example:
- Main Menu:
  - Options: `1. Login`, `2. Exit`.
- Login Menu:
  - Options: `1. Manage Users`, `2. Manage Portfolios`, `3. Logout`.

 Steps:
1. Create a 

cli

 folder to house the CLI logic.
2. Define constants for menu IDs and options (e.g., 

MAIN_MENU

, 

LOGIN_MENU

).
3. Implement functions to display menus and handle user input.
4. Integrate the CLI with the services to perform operations.

---

 5. Integrate Components
Once the CLI is implemented, integrate it with the services and domain objects. This is where the CLI interacts with the services, which in turn interact with the domain objects.

 Example:
- When the user selects "Manage Users" from the CLI, the CLI calls the `UserService` to perform the requested operation.

---

 6. Test the Application
Testing is critical to ensure your application works as expected.

 Steps:
1. Write unit tests for the domain objects, services, and CLI.
2. Test the integration of the CLI with the services.
3. Perform manual testing to ensure the menus and commands work as expected.

---

 7. Refactor and Optimize
After testing, refactor your code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Look for opportunities to:
- Remove duplicate code.
- Simplify complex logic.
- Improve error handling.

---

 8. Deploy and Maintain
Once the application is complete, deploy it and ensure it’s maintainable:
1. Package the application (e.g., using `setuptools` or `pyinstaller`).
2. Write documentation for the CLI and features.
3. Plan for future updates and enhancements.
